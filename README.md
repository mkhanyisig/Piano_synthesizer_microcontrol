Abstract: 
This project extrapolates on a failed initial idea I had for an earlier project, where I aimed to use capacitive touch sensing to make a more reactive piano, than the slow keyboard keys I had to enter via the serial port.  After the last lab however, I had a much better understanding on the technical depth relevant register requirements to achieve that goal. Using the ADC sensing capabilities, coupled with copper tape in our kit, that was enough to get me started creating a synthesizer piano instrument. Using the keyboard keys, an input is used to switch the frequency modes and also set the ADC flag to adjust the frequency when pitch is sustained. The full project demonstrates these capabilities and the inspiration behind it was the ability to play around with sounds and understand counters more, as those gave me a hard time in lab 4 and 5. My model is highly sensitive to capacitive touch and this allowed ease for users when playing some songs of choice.
